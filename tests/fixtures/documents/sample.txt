This is a sample text document for testing purposes.

It contains multiple paragraphs to verify that the document batch processor
correctly handles text files and creates appropriate chunks.

The processor should normalize this content and extract tokens properly.
This allows us to verify the bytesRead, tokensExtracted, and parseTimeMs statistics.

Final paragraph with some special characters: café, naïve, résumé.
