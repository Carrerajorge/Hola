The objective was to systematically analyze the application of machine learning in web advertising campaigns through a comprehensive review of scientific literature (2010-2025). The PRISMA methodology was implemented with five-dimensional quality criteria (0-3 points), selecting 42 excellent articles (13-15 points). The results reveal a dominance of deep learning (66.6%), with Deep Neural Networks (35.7%) and attention models (19.0%) predominating; convergence toward CTR as a universal metric (95.2%); concentration in e-commerce (61.9%), led by Alibaba (14.3%); and data sparsity as a fundamental limitation (59.5%). Significant algorithmic consolidation is found, but critical gaps in fairness (0%), sustainability (0%), and robustness (0%). Implications include the need for methodological diversification, the development of equity-aware frameworks, and expansion into sectors regulated by privacy-preserving techniques. © 2026 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Machine learning Digital advertising e-commerce","","","","J.A.

But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses. © © 2025 the Author(s).","ad prices; digital advertising; digital regulation; market concentration","advertising; antitrust law; article; commercial phenomena; competition; consumer; human; market; price; social media; suspension; United States; economics; Advertising; Commerce; Humans; Social Media","","We thank John Finlay, Mohamed Hussein, Kinshuk Jerath, Eric Johnson, Oded Netzer, Andrea Prat, Miklos Sarvary, Andrey Simonov, Olivier Toubia, and Catherine Tucker for their comments and Kenny Chen and Jeremy Fan from TikTok Global Business Solutions Marketing Science for support.","D.

We contrast data-augmented auctions, which leverage the platform's data advantage to improve match quality, with managed-campaign mechanisms that automate match formation and price-setting. The platform-optimal mechanism is a managed campaign that conditions the on-platform prices for sponsored products on the off-platform prices set by all advertisers. This mechanism yields the efficient on-platform allocation but inefficiently high off-platform product prices. It attains the vertical integration profit for the platform and the advertisers, and it increases off-platform product prices while decreasing consumer surplus, relative to data-augmented auctions. © he Author(s) 2024.

We examine how the relatively open mobile advertising ecosystem is nevertheless dominated by a handful of platform conglomerates, most prominently Google, Facebook, and Apple. Although extant scholarship acknowledges the concentration of corporate power in digital advertising, as well as its cultural, societal, and environmental harms, a comprehensive approach to platform power is missing. Providing a framework to develop such insights, we analyze how shifts in the advertising ecosystem are driven by four interrelated institutional platform strategies: infrastructuralization, platformization, conglomeration, and financialization. The 2021 introduction and subsequent rollout of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework serves as an example to demonstrate that even though institutional relationships of dependence are constantly evolving, control over infrastructural nodes tends to entrench the already dominant position of leading platform conglomerates. © The Author(s) 2025.","Apple; apps; digital advertising; infrastructure; platform power; platforms","","","","D.B.

With the discontinuation of third-party cookies and increased privacy standards, it has become harder for marketers to optimise advertising spend and attribution models. This paper explores the GDPR’s impact on the ad tech industry and anticipates challenges in adapting to a cookieless and more regulated data environment. In the wake of iPhone Operating System (iOS) updates and app tracking transparency, direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies have witnessed shifts in advertising spending across different channels. The study investigates three main measurement models: marketing-mix modelling (MMM), multi-touch attribution (MTA) and incrementality for D2C marketers, highlighting incrementality as the most effective method for analysing advertisement impact and optimising spending. The key contributions include a proposed triangulation framework that combines data from MMM, MTA and incrementality to support a data-driven approach, offering insights for tactical and strategic decision-making. To validate the proposed framework, a mixed-methods approach involving qualitative and quantitative surveys is designed. Targeting experienced advertising professionals, the survey evaluates the implementation of MMM and incrementality, assessing the various decision-making attributes of measurement models, such as ease-of-use, accuracy, validation, robustness, predictiveness etc. Results align with existing literature and the proposed framework, demonstrating the efficiency of each technique. The paper recommends adoption of the incrementality randomised control trial method and provides a roadmap for further research in this evolving landscape. © 2025, Henry Stewart Publications.

This study further tests whether advertising knowledge, familiarity and parental media mediation are associated with children’s consumer behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The approach adopted was a cross-sectional survey of 500 American parents with at least one child between the ages of 5 to 14 who were recruited via Qualtrics. Parents were asked about their familiarity with mobile/digital advertising and their knowledge of such material. They were also asked how they mediated their children’s media experience on the three mobile devices, how often their children asked for consumer goods and how often they argued with their children over the purchase of consumer goods. Findings: Results showed differences regarding how parents’ advertising knowledge and familiarity were linked to their mediational practices and their child’s consumer behavior. Specifically, advertising familiarity was associated with increased mediation across devices and increased purchase requests/conflict. Conversely, advertising knowledge was only associated with couse/viewing mediation, but this relationship was negative; moreover, knowledge was negatively associated with children’s consumer behavior. Originality/value: The results of this study offer insights into how knowledge and familiarity with mobile advertising shape parents’ mediational approaches to children.

The basic tenet of the framework is that six factors—privacy, trust, relevance, interactivity, entertainment, and brand-building—are associated with enhancing the effectiveness of digital advertising. Initially proposed as isolated factors, this analysis highlights the interconnected nature of these principles, offering a holistic perspective that underscores their collective impact on digital advertising effectiveness. In addition, the ways in which advances in recent technological advances, including generative artificial intelligence, artificial reality, virtual reality, gamification, and the presence of the metaverse have affected implementation of these principles by practitioners is discussed. By reexamining these foundational principles, this paper offers valuable insights for scholars and practitioners in gaining a deeper understanding of the complexities of interactive and immersive digital advertising. © 2025 American Academy of Advertising.","Brand-building; entertainment; interactivity; privacy; relevance; trust","","","","C.R.

Although consumers often welcome personalized and tailored ads, they may also deem such ads intrusive and may have privacy concerns. To address this paradox, this study examines individuals’ receptivity to personalized digital advertisements (RPDA)—specifically, their propensity to connect with and engage in such ads. We develop and validate the first comprehensive, empirically grounded scale to assess individuals’ RPDA. The scale is developed through six empirical studies involving approximately 1700 respondents. Findings reveal that RPDA comprises two dimensions: connection–consumers’ propensity to like PDA, and intention–consumers’ propensity to respond and act on such PDA. Consumers high in vanity are more receptive to PDA, which positively impacts their advocacy for brands that use PDA. As a result, this research enables practitioners to accurately measure consumer RPDA and identify optimal target segments. © 2025 Advertising Association.","Personalization; Receptivity to Personalized Digital Advertisements RPDA; Scale Development; Tailored Digital Advertising","","","","A.

Effective media planning and content management are crucial for capturing audience attention and achieving objectives such as brand recognition, increased traffic, user engagement, and loyalty building. However, few studies highlight the risks of prioritizing economic gains over ecological sustainability and the massive tons of CO2 emissions that an average digital ad campaign generates. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by introducing the novel framework of emission-smart advertising that balances the performance of digital advertising and CO2 emissions reduction. A two-phase methodology combined a qualitative study and the Delphi method. Based on our findings, we elaborate on innovative and rarely discussed theoretical, managerial, and community contributions.

This study evaluates the ad content changes from 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after the policy's enforcement. Methods: Text ads from Google searches in eight countries (Bahamas, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and United States) were collected in 2022, totaling 1,974 prepolicy and 3,262 post-policy ads, and analyzed in 2023. A gold standard database was established by two coders who labeled 707 ads, which trained five natural language processing models to label the ads, covering content and target demographics. The descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic models were applied to analyze content before versus after policy implementation, both globally and by country. Results: Vertex AI emerged as the best natural language processing model with the highest F1 score of 0.87. There were significant decreases from pre- to post-policy implementation in the prevalence of labels of “Racial or Ethnic Identification” and “Ingredients: Natural” by 47% and 66%, respectively. Notable differences were identified from pre- to post-policy implementation in India, Mexico, and Germany. Conclusions: The study observed changes in skin-lightening product advertisement labels from pre- to post-policy implementation, both globally and within countries. Considering the influence of digital advertising on colorist norms, assessing digital ad policy changes is crucial for public health surveillance. This study presents a computational method to help monitor digital platform policies for consumer product advertisements that affect public health. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","","depigmenting agent; advertising; Article; consumer; data mining; demographics; human; language processing; natural language processing; prevalence; propensity score; public health; public health surveillance; shade; South Africa; training; procedures; skin pigmentation; Advertising; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Skin Pigmentation","","Funding: The work presented in this manuscript was supported by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, based at the Harvard University T.H.

Methodology: Through a state-of-the-art analysis, prior knowledge regarding the application of nudges theory to marketing and digital advertising is collected and interpreted. Results: Despite the fact that the theory of nudges has demonstrated its effectiveness in various fields, positively influencing consumers’ behaviour, its use in the field of digital advertising has not been systematised. Discussions: This work has highlighted the lack of academic references in the application of nudges to the advertising world and especially to digital communication. Conclusions: The development of a model that allows us to relate the biases and heuristics that influence decision-making to specific digital nudges could improve the effectiveness of digital advertising campaigns. © 2024, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

This article aims to address this issue by offering a comprehensive and accessible review of four prominent data collection methods proposed in the marketing literature: “informal studies,” “multiple-ad studies without holdout,” “single-ad studies with holdout,” and “multiple-ad studies with holdout.” By outlining the strengths and limitations of each method, we aim to enhance understanding regarding the inferences that can and cannot be drawn from the collected data. Furthermore, we present seven recommendations to effectively leverage these tools for programmatic consumer research. These recommendations provide guidance on how to use these tools to obtain causal and non-causal evidence for the effects of marketing interventions, and the associated psychological processes, in a digital environment regulated by targeting algorithms. We also give recommendations for how to describe the testing tools and the data they generate and urge platforms to be more transparent on how these tools work. © The Author(s) 2024.","A/B testing; consumer behavior; experimental design; field experiments; online advertising; online experiments","","","","M.

Today, media communication is primarily shaped by both user control, where media users actively choose and determine their media experience, and system control, where media technologies and their underlying algorithms automatically generate and push relevant information to users. Understanding how both these processes influence media users’ perceptions of and responses to media messages is thus an important yet relatively unexplored topic in advertising research. This study aims to disentangle the effects of control and personalization in advertising. We explore how ad choice, representing self-controlled advertising communication, and ad personalization, representing system-controlled advertising communication, influence media users’ responses, including perceived control, perceived personalization, ad attitude, and visual attention. Findings showed an interaction effect between ad choice and ad personalization on perceived control. Ad personalization impaired perceived control only when consumers were given ad choices. We also found that having ad choices enhanced both perceived control and perceived personalization, which positively influenced ad attitude. Theoretical implications for disentangling the relationship between control and personalization as well as clarifying the conceptual differences between the objective and subjective aspects of these concepts are discussed. © 2024 American Academy of Advertising.","Eye-tracking; interactive advertising; perceived control; personalization","","","","X.

Drawing upon 110 interviews with 87 practitioners, participation in sector meetings and training courses, and McGowan’s ‘autoethnographic’ experiences, we explore the different forms tensions take in the two main configurations of digital advertising: (1) the ‘open marketplace,’ which is the site of much effort to turn mediators into intermediaries; and (2) ‘walled gardens,’ which increasingly are unequivocally mediators, and which are ‘de-agencing’ advertising’s human practitioners in specific ways (e.g. by making human-guided targeting less attractive and more difficult). De-agencing interacts with current initiatives, especially Apple’s, that partially ‘de-individualize’ advertising’s audiences and reinforce walled gardens’ mediator roles. © 2024 The Author(s).

Results: traditional media outlets, such as newspapers and magazines, are increasingly migrating to the online environment, taking advantage of the resources offered by the internet. In this context, advertising on digital media plays a key role in disseminating ideas, products and services. However, it is important to reflect on how this practice is associated with the discourse of surplus value. This essay therefore presents proposals and reflections on solutions to deal with the problems identified, including the implementation of more comprehensive regulations and the promotion of algorithmic transparency. Conclusions: The protection of users privacy and rights must be a priority, along with the promotion of transparency, fairness and non-discrimination. Only through the collective efforts of governments, companies, researchers and civil society can we address the challenges and strike a healthy balance between algorithms, digital advertising and individual rights. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

This paper outlines key benefits, unintended risks, and potential for manipulation across the three major types of targeting: demographic/psychographic, behavioral, and geographic with the goal of understanding how to maximize the benefits of targeted digital advertising while minimizing harm to consumer welfare. Because regulatory issues are complex as digital ad targeting practices continue to evolve, we consider similarities and differences across ad targeting types. We also make suggestions for future research to address pressing issues of relevancy, transparency, consent, autonomy, and vulnerability in digital ad targeting, by examining intricacies in the collection and dissemination of demographic/psychographic, behavioral, and geographic consumer data.

The older generation prefers traditional advertising due to technology's security and privacy aspects, leading to fewer choices in purchasing products. This study aimed to identify the relationship between the influence of Facebook and the effectiveness of digital advertising among Malaysian youth in Klang Valley. It was anticipated that this research would provide helpful information to the public and assist researchers in the future based on the findings of this topic area. Data was collected using a Google Form and distributed via social media like WhatsApp. The targeted respondents are between 15 and 34 years old and are located in the Klang Valley area. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27 system was used to determine digital advertising characteristics electronically. T-test and ANOVA tests were applied in this study to examine the demographic factors that affect the relationship between the variables, as different backgrounds influence the perspectives and behaviours of the users. The findings show that the independent variable, the influence of Facebook, has a strong correlation with the dependent variable, the effectiveness of digital advertising among Malaysian youth in Klang Valley (r= 0.770). Socio-demographic factors such as age and educational level had an effect on the relationship between the variables. The effectiveness of digital advertising is influenced by the number of likes, comments, and shares by Facebook users. © Universiti Telekom Sdn Bhd.

We design and run a field experiment on a large review platform across 18,294 firms in the restaurant industry to understand which types of businesses gain more from digital advertising. We randomly assign 7,209 restaurants to freely receive the platform’s standard ads package for three months. The scale of the experiment gives us a unique opportunity to assess the heterogeneity in advertising effectiveness across a variety of business attributes. We find that restaurants that receive advertising observe on average a 7%–19% increase in a wide range of purchase intention outcomes, as well as a 5% increase in customer reviews. We find that gains are heterogeneous across firms, with independent and higher-rated businesses observing larger gains, as well as those with more reviews and higher pre-experiment organic traffic. © 2023 INFORMS.","advertising; field experiments; restaurants; retail chains","","","","W.

Driven by computer science and engineering, blockchain technology is believed to decentralize the current system with its simple yet effective property of distributed ledger technology, which guarantees data transparency that can be seen by anyone in the network. With its robustness, blockchain technology can be applied to the centralized and multi-party-controlled current advertising ecosystem. Despite its potential, there is a lack of scientific discussion linking blockchain technology and advertising. In this essay, we examine the current challenges that render the measurement of advertising effects inefficient and untrustworthy in the advertising ecosystem. By focusing on such challenges as data transparency, consumer privacy, and ad fraud, we explain how blockchain technology can enhance the advertising system, making it more trustworthy from both technical and consumer standpoints. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Ad fraud; Ad privacy; Blockchain; Data transparency; Decentralized advertising","","","","J.

We focus the analysis on spending on Meta (which includes Facebook and Instagram) and Google (which includes YouTube and search-related ads). We identify just under $150 million in candidate spending in federal races on these two platforms. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that combined spending on Meta and Google was lower in federal races compared to 2020 as a share of media spending. We also focus our analysis on measuring the tone of digital ads on Meta and identifying the goals pursued by candidates in these digital ad buys. Our results confirm prior work that digital advertising remains more positive than television (and less issue-focused than television ads), and we find that nearly half of the candidate-sponsored spending on Meta in the 2022 general election period made appeals for donations, with significant variation across campaigns. The Meta and Google ad libraries are invaluable sources of data for measuring the digital strategies of campaigns, but the declines from 2020, particularly on Meta, suggest candidates are likely pursuing diverse digital investments across platforms, some with no transparency or capacity to track spending and content. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","abortion; digital ads; elections; Facebook; Google; Instagram; negative campaigns; YouTube","","","","E.F.

For the study, characterization parameters have been defined based on existing literature, defining five-dimension conceptualization: strength, fairness, engagement, trustworthiness and social role. Findings: The results point to a different perception of the phenomenon in some aspects that allow an intergenerational portrait of the figure of the influencer to be made. The findings of the study are innovative because they were not previously available and transcend academia to serve the companies that proliferate in the representation and management of influencers, as the characterization of this figure is important for the identification of key aspects in the adjustment of products and messages offered to a certain public of a specific population niche, both for advertising companies and for media and institutions. Originality/value: The study reveals interesting challenges for digital advertising from the audience's perceptions about influencers, highlighting the relevance of influencers which clearly contributes to a better understanding of more efficient strategies on digital advertising. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Communication; Digital advertising; Engagement; Gen X; Gen Z; Influencer; Parasocial relationship; Social media","","","","A.

Devaluing their embodied labour, they construe online interactions as fungible things while social classes are rendered as tangible digital collectivities. I demonstrate that visions of corporate social welfare and workspace control precarious working conditions against the background of an economy undergirded by high youth unemployment and flexible digital labour markets. I argue that the conditions of digital work reproduce the differential constitution of algorithmic technologies and worker subjectivity.

Treatment group participants were exposed to an 8-month-long advertising programme delivered via social media, designed to persuade people to vote against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. We found no evidence that the programme increased or decreased turnout on average. We found evidence of differential turnout effects by modelled level of Trump support: the campaign increased voting among Biden leaners by 0.4 percentage points (s.e. = 0.2 pp) and decreased voting among Trump leaners by 0.3 percentage points (s.e. = 0.3 pp) for a difference in conditional average treatment effects of 0.7 points (t<inf>1,035,571</inf> = −2.09; P = 0.036; DIC ̂ = 0.7 points; 95% confidence interval = −0.014 to 0). An important but exploratory finding is that the strongest differential effects appear in early voting data, which may inform future work on early campaigning in a post-COVID electoral environment. Our results indicate that differential mobilization effects of even large digital advertising campaigns in presidential elections are likely to be modest. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","advertising; human; politics; social media; Advertising; COVID-19; Humans; Politics; Social Media","","We thank D.

We situate this primer inside a critical look at the evolution of digital advertising that has been driven largely by immediate technological need for the maximization of profit rather than considerations for societal well-being. We discuss arenas in which the current state of digital advertising is not well positioned to maximize societal well-being and has built a consumer distrust of digital advertising, specifically with regard to the areas of privacy invasion, value to consumers, technology companies’ power, inaccuracies of personalizations, and misinformation spread. Throughout this article we discuss how blockchain technologies can be used as a research environment for testing new paths for digital advertising that could tackle these issues and be more beneficial to society.

The protection of consumer rights and the duty of correction must prevail among market agents. Its analysis, then, is interesting not only from the perspective of digital advertising or the theory of service contracts and advertising contracts, but also from the protection of the advertiser and the remedies available, the protection of the rights of consumers, users and competitors, because sometimes this practice can become abusive, aggressive, deceptive and unfair. © 2022 Universidad de Chile.

We examine how political campaign dynamics have evolved in response to the growth of digital media by analyzing the advertising strategies of US presidential election campaigns during the 2020 primary cycle. To identify geographic and temporal trends, we employ regression analyses of campaign spending across nearly 600,000 advertisements published on Facebook. We show that campaigns employed a new strategy of targeting voters in candidates’ home states during the “invisible primary.” In contrast to earlier studies, we find that home state targeting is a key strategy for all campaigns, rather than just for politicians with existing political and financial networks. While all candidates advertised to their home state, those who dropped out during the invisible primary tended to spend disproportionately more than the candidates who outlasted them. We also find that as the first wave of state caucuses and primary elections approach, campaigns shift digital ad expenditures to states with early primaries such as Iowa and New Hampshire and, to a lesser extent, swing states. © The Author(s) 2022.","campaign strategies; digital media; Facebook; political advertising","","","We thank Caitlin Chamberlain for superb research assistance, and Michael Bailey, Jonathan Ladd, David Lazer, Ryan Harrison, and participants of the 2019 Politics and Computational Social Science Conference at Georgetown University for helpful feedback.

We report the results of a ZIP code level randomized field experiment conducted over Facebook and Instagram during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections in Florida. The ads, produced by a Democratic-leaning political action committee, were designed to spur Democratic vote share and were seen more than 1.1 million times with over 100,000 full views. This wide saturation notwithstanding, we find that these advertisements had very small estimated effects on Democratic vote share at the precinct level (−0.04 percentage points, SE: 0.85 points).

The goal of this study is to develop a virtual experimental protocol to evaluate the dose-response effects of individual-level exposure to digital video ads on campaign outcomes in a naturalistic online browsing context. Methods: Young adults aged 18–24 years (n = 221) completed three 5 min viewing sessions on a realistic mock-up of the YouTube mobile app over a period of 2 weeks, followed by a 10-min survey after the third session. Participants were randomized to view between 0 and 6 exposures of ads from an e-cigarette prevention campaign; respondents viewed a total of 2 ads per session, with 0 to 2 of those ads being non-skippable digital video ads from the campaign and/or a dummy ad. The video ads played prior to short YouTube videos. Outcomes measured were self-reported ad recognition, frequency of ad exposure, and main message knowledge. Results: This study demonstrates a rapidly accessible virtual experimental protocol for evaluating the dose-response effects of digital advertising and individual-level outcomes. Five digital exposures of non-skippable video ads delivered via this platform over a 2-week period generated the highest ad recognition when there were up to six exposures. Higher exposure levels may be needed for message knowledge and ad-content-related effects. Conclusion: This protocol can be extended to investigate dose-response effects and mechanisms of action of individual-level exposure to digital advertising for multiple campaign outcomes, including changes in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Findings can inform evidence for adequate levels of digital exposure in public education campaigns. © The Author(s) 2022.","behavior change; digital; Health communications; online; prevention; remote clinical trials; smoking; social media","","European Commission, EC, (253013); European Commission, EC; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA253013); National Cancer Institute, NCI","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute, (grant number R01CA253013).","J.

This paper situates those insights in the theory of parties as extended networks and presents the first quantitative descriptive analysis of all companies that have provided federal political committees with digital advertising services in national elections. Network analysis measures of political groups registered with the Federal Election Committee in the United States (n = 2,064) and the types of companies they hired for digital political advertising services (political agencies, commercial agencies, digital advertising platforms, or other; n = 1,022) over three midterm and general elections (2006–2016) show that the number of political committees and companies have both dramatically increased since 2008 and that Facebook and Google have become the two most central members of the network. As influencers of the targeting and content of campaign messages, these companies should be considered consequential members of electoral party 0networks. This study contributes to research on political consulting and to the theory of parties as extended networks by demonstrating how opening the inclusion criteria for subject selection can uncover unexpected players, such as the private, previously considered nonpartisan, nonpolitical companies present here. © Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

We then ask a series of questions to distinguish between the important behavioral characteristics of bots versus humans in conducting click fraud within modern-day ad platforms. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the current detection and threat mitigation strategies pertaining to click fraud as discussed in the literature, and we categorize the surveyed techniques based on which specific actors within a digital advertising system are most likely to deploy them. We also offer insights into some of the best-known real-world click bots and their respective ad fraud campaigns observed to date.
