      "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.",

      "content": "Polar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean. They hunt seals from the edge of sea ice, often waiting for hours for seals to surface. Climate change is significantly impacting polar bear populations. As Arctic sea ice melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, polar bears have less time to hunt. This has led to declining body condition, lower survival rates for cubs, and population decreases in some regions.",
