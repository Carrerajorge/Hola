Security
Detected subprocess function 'run' without a static string. If this data can be controlled by a malicious actor, it may be an instance of command injection. Audit the use of this call to ensure it is not controllable by an external resource. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.
Security
Detected 'create_subprocess_exec' function without a static string. If this data can be controlled by a malicious actor, it may be an instance of command injection. Audit the use of this call to ensure it is not controllable by an external resource. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.
Security
Detected 'create_subprocess_exec' function with user controlled data. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.
Security
Detected asyncio subprocess function without a static string. If this data can be controlled by a malicious actor, it may be an instance of command injection. Audit the use of this call to ensure it is not controllable by an external resource. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.

Security
Avoid executing dynamically constructed SQL strings as this bypasses SQLAlchemy's SQL injection protections. Dynamic string construction makes the query vulnerable when user input is involved. Use `execute(text("... :param_name"), param_name=value)` with named parameters instead of f-strings/concatenation to ensure proper escaping.
